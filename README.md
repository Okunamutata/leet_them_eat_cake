This is my cynical, masochistic, take on "LeetCode" problems. 
Mainly ranging from easy to medium, w/ a few hard tossed in for good measure. 

The `SWE` world is fickle a & I need job security. So here it is; lol.
The problem set is located in `assets/problem-set.pdf`

Solutions are written entirely by myself, *no ai* 🤖.
- Just good old key-strokes, a notepad, and a pen. 
- The way god intended.... 😤.
Jk idc how you write your code. 
I enjoy working through these like puzzles when I have down time / no internet connectivity.
- p.s. Why is there no offline LeetCode equivalent. 
Sucks that I had to write all the stuff around the solutions instead of getting right to it. 🤷🏾‍♂️

## Run the program
Simply cd into `bin/`.
- In your terminal run something like 
  - `dart run leet_them_eat_cake.dart --max_profit "[7,1,5,3,6,4]"`
  - Replacing `--max_profit` and with the problem's name
  - To run each problem I've completed 
    - Take a look at `bin/problem_set/all_problems.dart` the `enum` `Problem` lists all solved problems.
    - If your unsure about the arguments needed to run, just run it w/o arguments. The console will print out example usages. 

## Who is this for?
- Me 🧔🏾‍♂️
  - sometimes I'm bored fr fr
- Future employer
  - Look I'm proficient at making solutions that are easily understood and performant  
  - And have a sense of humor
  - Arent I so employable 😉
- Those learning to code. 
  - Check it out. Its LeetCode problems w/o all the other stuff just code and solutions
  - Augment my solutions, try to implement them your self and use my solutions as a rubric.
  - And please feel free to fork or comment. And let me know if you found better/ more performant solutions. I def could always improve.
